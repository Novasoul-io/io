    <div class="quick-wins">
        <h3>🎯 The Big Picture: From Good to Extraordinary</h3>
        <p>Expressions 6.0 proved that with dedication and innovation, a school talent show can rival professional productions. By expanding from 2 to 4 rehearsals per week and implementing professional-grade technical systems, we created an experience that left audiences amazed. The path forward? <strong>Distribute responsibilities across more hands to make excellence sustainable.</strong></p>

        <div class="success-strategy">
            <div class="success-label">🎯 Enhanced Rehearsal Effectiveness</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Hosting rehearsals four days a week (up from two previously) for three weeks allowed significantly more hands-on coaching and development time with students</li>
                <li>The shift from having all kids at one rehearsal to smaller groupings of kids at rehearsal was an intentional change this year, and that was definitely a success</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="success-strategy">
            <div class="success-label">👥 Student Engagement & Responsibility</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Older students (7th/8th graders) took initiative in helping load and unload heavy equipment (speakers, mics, mixer) daily from vehicles</li>
                <li>These older students also responsibly escorted younger students back to aftercare, allowing adults to move on to next production tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="success-strategy">
            <div class="success-label">🎭 Enhanced Student Preparedness & Confidence</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent coaching on "If you're prepared, you won't be scared" messaging resonated strongly with performers</li>
                <li>Increased practice, mind-muscle connection work, and visualization led to kids being really mature, more confident performers this year compared to last</li>
            </ul>

                    <div class="problem-header">🚨 WHAT HAPPENED</div>
                    <p>Early in the show (during early vocal performances including AJ's and Journey's), the entire right-side main speaker was unplugged by parent volunteer for more than half the performance</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The overall mix was completely imbalanced, and to the audience this sounded like low volume of the vocals</li>
                        <li>This was not a "mic too low" issue but a complete loss of sound output from one side</li>
                        <li>This issue was identified and rectified by Steve much later, around the time the middle school acts began</li>
                        <li>This is why later acts generally sounded louder and fuller</li>

                    <p>It was the cinematography volunteer's first year. The team was introduced for cinematography work with giant spotlights (new for this year).

                        <li><strong>Loss of Show Automation:</strong> Many hours invested pre-programming all microphone settings, music cues, and lighting notes became unusable due to complete reordering</li>
                        <li><strong>Compromised Backstage Role:</strong> The shift to 100% manual audio mixing meant being physically tied to the soundboard, limiting backstage coaching and student management</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>There was a planned intermission that was crucial for technical resets and was on the program. This intermission was cancelled by the host on stage</li>
                        <li>A real-time decision was made for the 7th Grade Boys to perform immediately after Adanya's "Hallelujah," deviating from the revised program</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>System Impact:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Loss of Critical Reset Window:</strong> Cancelling the intermission eliminated the only planned opportunity to address technical issues</li>
                        <li><strong>Missed Announcement Opportunities:</strong> Lost chance for school announcements or showing content like the 8th Grade DC trip video</li>
                        <li><strong>Eliminated Mic Check:</strong> The planned dance act following Adanya was the last opportunity for a quick mic level check for the boys</li>
                        <li><strong>Direct Performance Impact:</strong> Boys went on stage with untested levels on three separate wireless microphone systems</li>

                    <p><strong>Consolidated Decision Authority:</strong> In the heat of live performance, the current model requires one person to balance audience flow, artistic vision, and technical requirements simultaneously. This concentration of decision-making—while ensuring unified direction—can inadvertently impact technical needs when split-second choices are required.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Scheduling Conflicts:</strong> The 7th Grade Boys had conflicting school-sanctioned track and choir events that prevented them from attending soundcheck and dress rehearsal.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Budget Constraints:</strong> Limited budget meant jerry-rigging four separate wireless systems instead of having a proper 4-8 channel system.</p>

                        <li>The intermission should be considered a non-negotiable production element</li>
                        <li>Real-time changes to running order should be avoided unless absolutely critical</li>
                        <li>Establish a core leadership committee for any live event changes</li>

                    <div class="problem-header">🚨 WHAT HAPPENED</div>
                    <p>Throughout the event, the technical lead was repeatedly addressed by name on the microphone regarding technical issues, many of which were direct results of the aforementioned external factors (speaker outage, program changes impacting automation)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>System Impact:</strong> This created an unfair public perception, especially as the full context of the issues was not shared with the audience</p>

                    <p>The current communication structure during live events defaults to public address when technical adjustments are needed. Without established discrete communication protocols, the person with the microphone naturally addresses the most visible technical position directly. The audience lacks context about external factors affecting technical operations.</p>

                    <p>The spotlights were not effective during the first half of the show, and the venue's acoustic properties amplified technical issues</p>

                        <li>Limited power infrastructure (one backstage plug, four front-stage plugs) constrained equipment placement</li>

                    <p>The venue presents specific design constraints that require intentional adaptation.
