        <h2><span class="emoji">‚ú®</span>1. GLOWS (Highlights & Successes)</h2>

        <h3>1. Increased Rehearsal Effectiveness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hosting rehearsals four days a week (up from two previously) for three weeks allowed significantly more hands-on coaching and development time with students</li>
            <li>We shifted from having all kids at one rehearsal to smaller groupings of kids at rehearsal. That was an intentional shift this year, and that was definitely a glow</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Student Engagement & Responsibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Older students (7th/8th graders) took initiative in helping me load and unload heavy equipment (speakers, mics, mixer) daily from my car</li>
            <li>These older students also responsibly escorted younger students back to aftercare, allowing adults to move on</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Enhanced Student Preparedness & Confidence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I would coach them on "If you're prepared, you won't be scared" and that resonated</li>
            <li>Increased practice, mind-muscle connection work, and visualization led to kids being really mature, more confident performers this year compared to last</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Stronger Student Camaraderie</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A positive culture and stronger sense of camaraderie among the student performers was evident, beautifully reflected in the final song</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Early Rehearsal Start</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting rehearsals three weeks prior to the show rather than two weeks prior to the show provided a good foundation (though future planning could start even earlier for key deadlines)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Student Production Team Initiative</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We started something called a student intern team. I put their names on the back of the program and they showed great interest and dedication in learning and executing their roles in drone operation, photography, and spotlighting</li>
            <li>This indicates strong potential for a student intern program, maybe connected to after school enrichments. It's a natural conduit for kids who are interested in the more behind the scenes aspects of things. It could be more year round, or at least that trimester</li>

        <h3>2.1. Technical Integrity - Primary Speaker Unplugged for More Than Half the Performance</h3>
        
        <div class="issue">
            <div class="issue-label">‚óè ISSUE:</div>
            <p>Early in the show (during early vocal performances including AJ's and Journey's), the entire right-side main speaker was unplugged by parent volunteer for more than half the performance</p>
        </div>

        <div class="impact">
            <div class="impact-label">‚óè IMPACT:</div>
            <ol>
                <li>The overall mix was completely imbalanced, and to the audience this sounded like low volume of the vocals</li>
                <li>This was not a "mic too low" issue but a complete loss of sound output from one side</li>
                <li>This issue was identified and rectified by Steve much later, around the time the middle school acts began. Steve is a parent volunteer who worked with me in the past, and who has a young grandchild who will be in the community for a while and will be a great person to continue to own this work in the future</li>
                <li>This is why later acts generally sounded louder and fuller</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="impact">
            <div class="impact-label">‚óè CAUSE (Context):</div>
            <p>It was the cinematography volunteer's first year. We introduced them and their team for cinematography. You may have noticed the giant spotlights that are on each side of the stage - that was new for this year. The consequence of that is they needed to plug in their equipment, and when they were doing some power shifting around, their equipment needed an outlet that led to a combination of powering off the speaker and they accidentally forgot to plug the speaker back on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="future-consideration">
            <div class="future-label">‚óè üå± FUTURE CONSIDERATION:</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Designate a single, technically knowledgeable point person (or very small, clearly defined team) solely responsible for ALL power distribution and audio/lighting connections</li>
                <li>No other individuals should adjust or unplug critical equipment without direct confirmation from this lead</li>
                <li>Conduct a full system sound check immediately before doors open and after any changes to power or connections are made</li>
                <li>An intermission (see Grow 2.2) would have provided a crucial window to diagnose and fix this critical issue much sooner</li>

        <h3>2.2. Program Finalization & Live Event Adaptability</h3>

        <h4>2.2.1. Issue 1: Extremely Late Program Order Finalization</h4>
        
        <div class="issue">
            <div class="issue-label">‚óè ISSUE 1:</div>
            <p>The graphical event program order, initially agreed upon Tuesday, underwent significant revisions. Despite consistent requests for updates, the final order was not confirmed by the show director until 3:00 PM on Friday (event day)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="impact">
            <div class="impact-label">‚óè IMPACT 1:</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Graphics Redesign Rush:</strong> Left only one hour to completely redesign the graphical program, incorporate new information, finalize the layout, deliver it to Molly for printing/distribution, and travel to the venue</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed Arrival & Critically Shortened Soundcheck:</strong> Consequently, I arrived at 5:00 PM. This allowed minimal time for any soundcheck, critically impacting the 7th Grade Boys who had specifically missed that week's soundcheck and the dress rehearsal due to conflicting school-sanctioned track and choir schedules
                    <ul><li><strong>First-Ever Testing:</strong> This performance was their first-ever time testing their mics and vocals together on this system</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Show Automation ‚û°Ô∏è Mandatory Manual Operation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I had invested many hours pre-programming all microphone settings, music cues, and lighting notes into an automated sequence tied to the original program order</li>
                        <li><strong>System Capabilities:</strong> This system allows for near hands-free operation between acts (e.g., a separate non technical person, in this case the live stream intern, could press "Act 2" and all settings would load for that act)</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete Reordering Impact:</strong> The last-minute complete reordering made this automation unusable as there was no time to reprogram</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Compromised Backstage Role:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The shift to 100% manual, hands-on audio mixing for every act meant I was physically tied to the soundboard</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Capacity:</strong> This severely limited my ability to provide planned backstage coaching, manage student flow/discipline (as I was the only adult consistently backstage), and oversee the student production team</li>
                        <li><strong>Additional Issues:</strong> This also contributed to issues like a performer playing with their mic until the battery died, as direct oversight was split</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

        <div class="future-consideration">
            <div class="future-label">‚óè üå± FUTURE CONSIDERATION 1:</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Implement a strict 48-hour (or earlier) pre-event deadline for ALL program content and and order finalization. This is non-negotiable for graphical programs requiring design and for technical programming</li>
                <li>Any changes after this deadline must be by collective agreement of a core event leadership team (e.g., FTC leads, technical lead, host), with full understanding of the technical and logistical ripple effects</li>
                <li>Consider scheduling the overall event arc (major performance blocks, intermission) 2‚Äì3 months in advance to minimize conflicts with other school activities</li>

                <li>A real-time decision was also made for the 7th Grade Boys to perform immediately after Adanya's performance of "Hallelujah," deviating from the revised program which had a dance act next
                    <ul><li>(The original program draft allowed for this buffer after "Hallelujah" for this very reason, but it was redone)</li></ul>

        <div class="impact">
            <div class="impact-label">‚óè IMPACT 2:</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Loss of Critical Reset Window:</strong> Cancelling the intermission eliminated the only planned opportunity to address technical issues (like the speaker outage), check mic batteries, or make adjustments</li>
                <li><strong>Missed Announcement Opportunities:</strong> If the concern is people getting out of their chairs, that's understandable reasoning, but from a production standpoint it has downstream impacts. If the underlying value is how can we do an intermission that doesn't disrupt or force people to get up, it's an opportunity for school announcements, or showing content like the 8th Grade DC trip video</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminated "Hail Mary" Mic Check for 7th Grade Boys:</strong> The planned dance act following Adanya was the last potential, albeit rushed, opportunity for a quick mic level check for the boys</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Performance Impact:</strong> Removing this act and moving them up directly resulted in them going on stage with untested levels on three separate, complex wireless microphone systems</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Constraints Context:</strong> There was a budget constraint that limited how we could do the wireless microphone system. Rather than having a four or eight channel system, I had to jerry rig four separate wireless systems, one and two at a time, due to budget constraints</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Future Consideration:</strong> The connection to this is for the school to invest in a microphone system and think about how that allows for groups to perform and partnerships to be made, like BJ and his group who started performing in the fourth grade together - they named their group the Black Stars. They became closer as friends from performing together, and expressions can have grouped acts. The idea of groups and tools to facilitate that, like multiple microphones on standby, absolutely allows for bonds to form in a different kind of way, lifelong bonds, and so there's value attached to having an in-house system with multiple microphones.

                <li>The intermission should be considered a non-negotiable production element. Its value for technical adjustments, performer well-being, and audience experience is immense</li>
                <li>Real-time changes to the running order should be avoided unless absolutely critical and, if possible, discussed with the technical lead due to their significant impact on a live, cued show</li>

        <p><strong>To our students,</strong> especially those whose performances were impacted by these technical challenges: I am truly sorry. I invested deeply in each of you, bringing my personal equipment and dedicating weeks to coaching, all with the goal of helping you shine your brightest. It's heartbreaking when external factors prevent that full potential from being realized.</p>
        
        <p><strong>To the FTC Leadership,</strong> this recap is offered not to dwell on negatives, but to learn and build, and to more intentionally systematize this production for future years. This speaks to how I believe it unlocks potential - BJ has now performed twice at Yoshi's and it started with expressions as that conduit. I believe in these kids immensely. In that spirit, I'd like to propose ideas to continue celebrating their talents:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="proposal">
        <h3><span class="emoji">üé™</span>Future Opportunities</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Carnival Encore Performances:</strong> In past years, select talent show acts have reprised their performances at the school carnival. I would love for AJ, and the 7th Grade Boys, among others, to have this opportunity for a great performance in a different, fun setting.</li>
            
            <li><strong>"Expressions Sessions":</strong> BJ and I were talking over the weekend and had an idea. I would like to host a Tiny Desk style performance and shoot a Tiny Desk style video for all vocalists in my home studio, using professional cameras, lighting and audio. I could do that as soon as this week. Everything is all ready to go and the name of it would be Expressions Sessions.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Thank you for your dedication to our school and for considering these points. I am confident that with collaborative planning and clear roles, future events will be even more outstanding.</p>
