            <div class="success-label">🎯 Enhanced Rehearsal Effectiveness</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Hosting rehearsals four days a week (up from two previously) for three weeks allowed significantly more hands-on coaching and development time with students</li>
                <li>The shift from having all kids at one rehearsal to smaller groupings of kids at rehearsal was an intentional change this year, and that was definitely a success</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Older students (7th/8th graders) took initiative in helping load and unload heavy equipment (speakers, mics, mixer) daily from vehicles</li>
                <li>These older students also responsibly escorted younger students back to aftercare, allowing adults to move on to next production tasks</li>

                <li>Consistent coaching on "If you're prepared, you won't be scared" messaging resonated strongly with performers</li>
                <li>Increased practice, mind-muscle connection work, and visualization led to kids being really mature, more confident performers this year compared to last</li>

                <li>Pre-programmed automation system with physical controller allowing non-technical personnel to operate complex audio transitions with single button presses</li>

                <li>This indicates strong potential for a student intern program, maybe connected to after school enrichments. It's a natural conduit for kids who are interested in the more behind the scenes aspects of things. It could be more year round, or at least that trimester</li>

        <p>These grows highlight opportunities to evolve from a consolidated decision-making model to a distributed leadership structure. The issues below demonstrate how concentrating multiple critical decisions in any single role—regardless of the individual—can create operational bottlenecks and compound technical challenges. The solutions focus on distributing decision-making authority across specialized roles to improve both efficiency and outcomes.</p>

                <div class="problem-header">🚨 WHAT HAPPENED</div>
                <p>Early in the show (during early vocal performances including AJ's and Journey's), the entire right-side main speaker was unplugged by parent volunteer for more than half the performance</p>
                
                <p><strong>System Impact:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overall mix was completely imbalanced, and to the audience this sounded like low volume of the vocals</li>
                    <li>This was not a "mic too low" issue but a complete loss of sound output from one side</li>
                    <li>This issue was identified and rectified by Steve much later, around the time the middle school acts began</li>
                    <li>This is why later acts generally sounded louder and fuller</li>

                <p>It was the cinematography volunteer's first year. The team was introduced for cinematography work with giant spotlights (new for this year). When they were doing power shifting, their equipment needed an outlet that led to powering off the speaker and they accidentally forgot to plug the speaker back on.</p>

                    <li><strong>Loss of Show Automation:</strong> Many hours invested pre-programming all microphone settings, music cues, and lighting notes became unusable due to complete reordering</li>
                    <li><strong>Compromised Backstage Role:</strong> The shift to 100% manual audio mixing meant being physically tied to the soundboard, limiting backstage coaching and student management</li>
